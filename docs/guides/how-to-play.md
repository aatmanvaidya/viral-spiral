# Special Power : Cancel a Player
When you cross a threshold for any affinity, you unlock the special power to cancel a player. This means that this player would miss a turn. If their turn hasn't come in the current round, they will skip the turn in this round and if it has, then they will skip it in the next round.

When players use this power, they can select which affinity they are using for this power and one affinity point will be deducted for that affinity.
When a user initiates the process to cancel a player, other players who have the same polarity for that affinity will be asked to vote to cancel the player. The majority vote decides the fate of the target player.
